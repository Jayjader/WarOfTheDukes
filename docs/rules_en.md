## Game Rules

### Story

For the past three hundred years, the Dukes of Orfburg and Wulfenburg have been engaged
in a border conflict over the town of Kaiserburg and the territory found
between the two branches of the river. Thirty years ago, after a lengthy
battle, the Duke of Wulfenburg retook Kaiserburg, but was unable to render
himself master of the "Two Rivers Territory".

After thirty years of armed peace, the Duke of Orfburg has declared war on his
old enemy. His goal: retake Kaiserburg, of course. It is this "War of the
Dukes" that you will reenact. This initiation game, kept voluntarily simple, is
designed to familiarise beginners with the basic principles of war games, as
well as give a decently realistic example of the "Napoleon" theme.

# War of the Dukes

### The game

For 2 players.  
Game materials:
 - a geographic map with hexagonal tiles,
 - pawns (to be cut out),
 - a combat result table and a terrain effect table printed directly on the map,
 - a dice will also need to be procured.

There are a total of 31 pawns per side (plus 1 turn counter), thusly: 1 Duke;
10 infantry units; 10 cavalry units; 10 artillery units.

These pawns have one of the following symbols (conforming to NATO's code):

[X] for infantry; [/] for cavalry; [Â·] for artillery;

and a crown for the Duke. They also display:
 - the beginning of their country's name: "ORF" (for Orfburg) and WULF (for
   Wulfentburg),
 - on the left, a number representing the offensive and defensive power,
 - on the right, a number representing the mobility potential (movement
   points),
 - solely for artillery, in the upper left, the number 2 is a reminder of the
   canons' 2 tile range

#### Game Objective

Decisively conquer territory or annihilate the Duke or the enemy forces. As we
shall see, a particular feature of the War of the Dukes is that the players'
situations are not symmetrical: they do not exactly share the same winning conditions.

#### Setting up the Pawns

Each player places one of their units on each city or fortress tile they own. Next, they take turns placing their remaining units on tiles they possess until all have been placed.  
The player owning Orfburg always plays first.

#### Game Length

The game lasts up to 15 turns, which are kept track of by moving the turn
tracker pawn forwards 1 square at the end of each turn.  
Each turn is further divided into 2 phases, each corresponding to the different
actions of 1 of the 2 players. Once both adversaries have played, the current
turn is over, and the next turn begins.

#### The Dukes

The 2 pawns representing the Dukes only have defensive power: they cannot
attack directly. However, their presence "inspires" their troupes within 2
tiles, doubling their offensive or defensive potential.  
The Dukes are affected by combat results just like any other pawn. In
particular, a Duke can be eliminated during the course of a battle. In that
case, the game immediately ends and the player they belong to loses, even if
the other victory conditions are not satisfied.


#### Fortresses

Fortresses may not contain more than one unit (eventually plus 1 Duke, who
doesn't count as a unit). Without a garrison, they are defenseless and may be
occupied by pawns from either side. Artillery units may fire from within a
fortress.

#### Victory Conditions

The two belligerents do not have the same conditions for victory.

#### Marginal Victory

The Duchy of Orfburg wins by seizing the city of Kaiserburg, all while
maintaining control of the territory between the two rivers. The Duchy of
Wulfenburg wins by preventing at least 1 of those 2 conditions.

##### Total Victory

Total victory is given to the country that conquers the opposing capital or
eliminates the enemy Duke.

#### Movement

During their active phase, each player may move as many units as they desire
to, within the limits of each unit's movement points. Here is the number of
points needed to move one tile, depending on the nature of the terrain:

terrain        | movement points per tile
---------------|-------------------------
roads          | 0.5
cities         | 0.5
normal         | 1
bridges        | 1 (0.5 if a road crosses the bridge)
woods          | 2
cliffs (brown) | 2
rivers         | Impassable other than via bridges
lakes          | Impassable


Note: if a unit wishing to traverse a road during their movement is not already
on that road, it must first spend the necessary movement points to reach the
road by crossing the terrain that separates it from the road.

#### Movement Restrictions

A unit may never occupy the same tile as another unit, allied or enemy.
However, units may move through other allied units with no penalty.  
Special case: the Duke, which may be placed on another allied unit.

#### Zone of Control

Each unit exerts a particular influence on the 6 tiles adjacent to it: theses
tiles constitute its "Zone of Control". These Zones of Control have the
following properties:

 - a unit may enter an enemy Zone of Control for no additional movement cost,
   but may not move within in; the unit must thus end its movement upon
   entering the Zone,
